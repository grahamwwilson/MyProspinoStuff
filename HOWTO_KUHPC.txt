HOWTO run Prospino in batch on KU HPC.

1. cd $WORK              # (You should now be in /panfs/pfs.local/work/wilson/$USER)
2. mkdir ProspinoOut     # for job output 
3. git clone https://github.com/grahamwwilson/MyProspinoStuff.git
4. mkdir Prospino_Launch # for launch script and job logs
5. cd Prospino_Launch
6. cp /panfs/pfs.local/work/wilson/gwwilson/Prospino_Launch/launch.sh .
7 ./launch.sh

You may also want to use collate.sh in /panfs/pfs.local/work/wilson/gwwilson/ProspinoOut 
to make summary files like Wagner.out and test.out with the calculated cross-sections for all the 
production modes after the batch job array has completed.
See ExampleOutput directory with examples of these.
