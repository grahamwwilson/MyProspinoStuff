HOWTO run Prospino in batch on KU HPC.

Default job calculates all 51 production processes -- mostly sleptons and electroweakinos.

1. cd $WORK              # (You should now be in /panfs/pfs.local/work/wilson/$USER)
2. mkdir ProspinoOut     # for job output 
3. git clone https://github.com/grahamwwilson/MyProspinoStuff.git
4. mkdir Prospino_Launch # for launch script and job logs
5. cd Prospino_Launch
6. cp /panfs/pfs.local/work/wilson/gwwilson/Prospino_Launch/launch.sh .
7. Edit the underlying script (run_prospino_array.sh) so that it does not send ME E-mail
8 ./launch.sh            # This submits the script (MyProspinoStuff/HPC-Specific/run_prospino_array.sh) to the batch system

# The above uses an executable and some other input files from my Prospino directory 
# that likely should not normally need to be remade.

You may also want to use collate.sh in /panfs/pfs.local/work/wilson/gwwilson/ProspinoOut 
to make summary files like Wagner.out and test.out with the calculated cross-sections for all the 
production modes from the particular SLHA file after the batch job array has completed.
See ExampleOutput directory with examples of these. The last column in pb is the one to care about.

For your own study you likely will need to supply your own SLHA file and change the script 
to pick it up. Easiest is to put it in the SLHAFiles directory.
If the jobs start immediately one SLHA file typically takes < 5 minutes 
to complete the job array.

The correspondence to production channel can be deduced from the masses and the 
conventions in the main program which is in MyProspinoStuff/prospino_main.f90.
Eg.  nn 2 5 is N2 C1+ production.

Update 04-JUL-2022

Basic jobs now have center-of-mass energy optional argument which can be specified 
when submitting the scripts (defaults to 13000 GeV if not specified) and also 
the SLHA optional file argument. 
See launch.sh, slaunch.sh and hlaunch.sh in my Prospino_Launch directory.

sbatch $WORK/MyProspinoStuff/HPC-Specific/run_prospino_array.sh 13600 ${SLHA}
sbatch $WORK/MyProspinoStuff/HPC-Specific/run_prospino_sleptons.sh 14000 ${SLHA}
sbatch $WORK/MyProspinoStuff/HPC-Specific/run_hino_array.sh 13600 Higgsinos_250.0-235.0-220.0

To make customized SLHA files like Higgsinos_250.0-235.0-220.0.slha in the SLHAFiles directory.
Run the higgsino.sh script as follows.
./higgsino.sh 250.0 235.0 220.0

Similarly for sleptons all with the same mass.
./sleptons.sh 300.0
leads to Sleptons_M300.0.slha
